# rust_book
This repository contains Rust code that I have written as part of exercises in The Rust Programming Language book, aka 'The Book'. Each directory within this repository reflects a particular chapter in the book, prefixed by the chapter index. 

Code comments are used heavily throughout this repository in an effort to better understands the concepts. 

Please feel free to clone this repository for your own use.
