# rust_book
This repository contains Rust code that I have written as part of exercises in The Rust Programming Language book, aka 'The Book'. Each directory within this repository reflects a particular chapter in the book, prefixed by the chapter index. 

You will notice that Chapter 4, which covers ownership, is missing from this repository. I opted to use Notion to write about ownership in an effort to better understand it, rather than adding code to this repository.
